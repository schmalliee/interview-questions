# interview-questions

This is a simple Vue app to display Software Testing interview questions in notecard format.

#### [Questions](https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-interview-questions.html)
The questions are a little wonky because they're entirely split programmatically into json format. This lost a lot of the crucial elements like bullets and newlines - but it's mostly still legible 

#### [Vue-Flip Component](https://github.com/kgrandemange/vue-flip#readme)
Given my limited time, I chose to use an existing flip component
